# burger
A demonstration of the MVC design pattern using SQL, Express, and Handlebars.  The sample app allows the user to create a burger and choose which burger to eat.

Burgers are added and updated in a remote sql database.  Eating burgers changes their "devoured" state both locally and on the database.  The new burger function adds a new burger record to the database, and alerts if the user didn't enter a new name.  The reset button moves all burgers to the un-eaten state.
